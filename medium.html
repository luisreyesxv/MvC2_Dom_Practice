      <!-- The default <h1> tag (with the style "text-align:center") will default saying "You have not selected any characters."" You need to make it so when a person clicks
        on an avatar, the <h1> tag changes to "you have selected (the characters name)". You can do this I believe in you. --> 
      <h1 style="text-align: center"> YOU HAVE NOT SELECTED ANY CHARACTERS</h1>
      <div class="container" > </div>
<!-- Above is a <div> tag with the class name "container",  you need to make a <a> with the class "character" nested inside of the <div> tag above. nested inside <a> should be a 
  <span> with the class name "character-inside". and inside that should bbe an <img> with the character's avatar inside. Everything should be loaded right away with Dom Content Loaded
    Each avatar should have an eventlistener that affects the <h1> above according to the note inside. You can do it my fellow human. -->
